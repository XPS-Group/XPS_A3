eXtensible Project System for Arma 3

Based off a project called the eXtensible Planning System, a project that was intended to introduce a AI framework for the following:
  - An object-oriented framework using Hashmaps as a sort of 'object' for extensibility of features
  - Behavio(u)r Trees for Arma 3
  - Goal-Oriented Action Planning for use with AI
  - Pathfinding for Terrain, Action Planning Nodes, and other AI related searches that benefit from A* searching
  - Danger/Formation FSM possibilities
  - K-Dimensional Trees for fast searching of large amounts of data

All goals meant to enhance and extend AI possibilities by implementing this core framework but, without the need to encompass those possibilities into a single 'mod'
 
Since the announcement to introduce a new hashmap command 'createHashmapObject' for v2.14, this project is being rewritten to include not only the above but also these additional features to the framework:
  - A better OOP approach (an example is to include an Interface-style contract system for building objects) and a general framework to foster Mod compatibility at the scripting level using those objects.
 
 Ultimately, it is my hope and goal to provide a bit more creativity in the community. All constructive criticism and ideas are welcome here.
